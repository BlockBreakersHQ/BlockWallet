//! THORChain: the only non-custodial route this wallet has for swapping BTC or LTC.
//!
//! Neither Bitcoin nor Litecoin has an on-chain DEX, so a same-chain aggregator cannot help
//! them. THORChain settles cross-chain by holding liquidity in vaults on each chain: you pay
//! the inbound vault on the source chain with a memo describing what you want, and the network
//! pays your address on the destination chain. No company takes ownership, but the funds are
//! genuinely out of your control between the two legs, which is why [`Custody::ProtocolVault`]
//! is reported and shown to the user.
//!
//! # Failure modes this guards against
//!
//! THORChain forfeits, rather than refunds, several classes of mistake:
//!
//! * paying a vault while the chain or the network is halted;
//! * paying less than the inbound minimum;
//! * paying a stale vault address after a churn.
//!
//! So `inbound_addresses` is re-read at quote time and never cached, the halt flags are treated
//! as hard refusals, and the minimum is enforced in [`super::safety`] rather than displayed.
//!
//! As of this writing the network's global `HALTTRADING` mimir is set, so `halted` comes back
//! true for every chain and quoting refuses. That is the correct behaviour, not a bug.
